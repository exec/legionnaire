## ðŸ“‹ User Journey Analysis

### Typical User Workflows That Must Work:

#### 1. **First-Time User**
```bash
# Download and run
cargo install legionnaire
legionnaire --setup

# Should guide through:
# - Server selection (preset list + custom)
# - Nickname setup
# - Channel selection  
# - Security preferences (TLS, E2EE)
# - Plugin recommendations
```

#### 2. **Daily Usage**
```bash
# Simple connection
legionnaire                    # Use default profile
legionnaire work              # Use work profile
legionnaire --server libera   # Quick connect

# Must handle:
# - Network interruptions gracefully
# - Rejoin channels on reconnect
# - Restore encryption state
# - Resume plugin functionality
```

#### 3. **Power User**
```bash
# Bouncer setup for persistent connection
legionnaire --bouncer &
legionnaire send "#channel" "hello"  # CLI integration
legionnaire-tui                      # TUI connects to bouncer

# Bot management
legionnaire plugin load weather-bot
legionnaire plugin config weather-bot '{"api_key": "..."}'
```

#### 4. **Corporate/Team Usage**
```bash
# Shared configuration
LEGIONNAIRE_CONFIG=/shared/irc-config.toml legionnaire
legionnaire --profile team --server internal.irc.company.com

# Compliance requirements:
# - Audit logging
# - E2EE enforcement
# - Plugin restrictions
```
